The tasks I have completed during this course

Each folder is a task that was assigned. Each folter has Jupyter Notebook file, the dataset worked on, report if needed and PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook.
I unfortunately don't keep the task questions that were asked from us but I have gotten high score from my tasks and also I tried to explain what I am doing as much as I can in my Jupyter Notebooks/PDFs.
